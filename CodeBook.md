CodeBook

This CodeBook will describe the 66 different variables in the "Tidy Data.txt" data table.  It will also address the different activities that the subject were tested over.

The activities the subjects were tested across were as follows (these are found in the Activity column of the data table):

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

The "Tidy Data.txt" file also contains the following columns.  The original data included many different readings for each one of these items.  In the process of developing the "Tidy Data.txt" data table, we have aggregated the values to indicate the average across each subject and activity for each feature.

Before providing the list of the columns used we have included a description of the original data, of which we took the mean.  The actual science behind the acceleromter data is beyond the scope of this course, and I leave that description to the original study authors (with appropriate citation).  Except for taking the average of the values, there was no other manipulation of the values.

List of columns follows the cited excerpt.

-- From the Original Study --
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
